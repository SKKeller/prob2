# Setting up a development environment

We assume, you have a fresh copy of Eclipse 4.2 and an empty workspace at hand. Furthermore, we assume that you have a recent version of gradle (http://www.gradle.org/) installed on your computer. Gradle 1.1 or newer will be sufficient.

1. Install Groovy-Eclipse for Juno using the Eclipse Marketplace.
2. Clone the prob2 repository to some location (e.g. gitrepo/prob2). 
   We assume that gitrepo is a directory outside your Eclipse workspace. 
3. cd into gitrepo/prob2 and call "git checkout worksheet" run `gradle magic` 
4. run `gradle war` (needs to be called again after cleanUp of de.prob.core.kernel/bin)
5. In Eclipse, choose File | Import | General | Existing projects into workspace. Select gitrepo/prob2 as root directory. 
6. Import all projects.
7. Open the file de.prob.core.rodin/prob_target.target and click "Set as Target Platform" (upper right corner). 
   This will take a while ...
8. Select "Run as Eclipse application" from the context menu of de.prob.ui. This will open a new Eclipse Window and create a fresh run configuration.
9. Close the new Eclipse window and edit the run configuration. Change "Run a product" to org.rodinp.platform.product.
10. Start the configuration again. This time it will start Rodin.
11. Open the Groovy Console view (in the view category "Others") and type 'upgrade latest'. This will download a fresh copy of the Prolog binaries.

IMPORTANT:
-  The PermGenSpace for the application grows to nearly 100MB so the vm option -XX:MaxPermSize=120m needs to be set

-  When adding additional projects which are dependant on de.prob.core.kernel make sure to mark them as optional in their MANIFEST files for the tycho build
